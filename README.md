The Line-Following-Robot-with-bluetooth-overdrive is a project that creates a robot using an Arduino Mega board, hc-05 bluetooth module, 3 infrared sensors, and an L298N motor driver. It follows a line and can be overridden via Bluetooth. The code uses interrupts, timers without delays, and can be improved to become fully autonomous.
