# Line-Following-Robot-with-bluetooth-overdrive
The Line-Following-Robot-with-bluetooth-overdrive is a robot that follows a line on the ground using sensors and can be remotely controlled via Bluetooth. It's a great project for learning about robotics, electronics, and programming, and for developing skills in problem-solving, innovation, and creativity.


This project is made as a line following robot which stops every 5 seconds interval and has the capability to be overridden by bluetooth technology
It is developed for a Arduoino Mega board with hc-05 bluetooth module and 3 infrared sensors and a L298N motor driver. 

The code includes interrupts, timers without delays and will be improved further to a full scaled autonomus system.
